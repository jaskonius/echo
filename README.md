# echo
A TUI music player.

## Status
Early development, yada yada yada.

Somewhere down my todo list there is a settings menu but as it is dead simple to change configs just in the file (.config/echo/config.toml), use that until then.

## Build
On Fedora, you need to install `alsa-lib-devel` (required by rodio / alsa-sys)

On Debian based systems, install `libasound2-dev` (required by rodio / alsa-sys)
